# Data Cleaning Example

This repo holds code demonstrating the ongoing process of data cleaning used by the [Vanderbilt CIBS Center](http://icudelirium.org).

The code refers to a sample [REDCap](https://projectredcap.org/) database for a three-month longitudinal study of adult patients taking a dietary supplement and measuring creatinine, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and weight over time. (Sample database is adapted with thanks from REDCap's project templates.) The [study codebook](codebook.pdf) is included here.

The [**primary tutorial**](https://github.com/jenniferthompson/DataCleanExample/blob/master/dataclean.pdf) is likely the resource of major interest. There is also an [example R script](https://github.com/jenniferthompson/DataCleanExample/blob/master/dataclean_script.R), purled/tangled from the tutorial, that can serve as a base for developing your own data cleaning script. Other files are included as noted in the tutorial.

These materials were originally developed for a workshop series at Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan, June 2018, but are written to be used publicly under
an [MIT license](LICENSE.md). Toy data is included here for those without access
to OCU's REDCap instance.
