# Hello! 👋

I am sorry I could not learn Japanese in time 😔

Please tell me if I need to speak more slowly or repeat something!

# Workshop Preparation

---

# Please ask questions! 🙋🏻

1. Raise your hand any time!
1. Ask in Slack: `#redcappers_r_vu`
1. Sticky notes! Yellow = "I need help", blue = "I'm finished"

---

# Download Files from Github

1. github.com/jenniferthompson/DataCleanExample
1. Click green button, then "download as zip"

Your printed PDF will have everything you need for reference, but if you want to run the code as we go through it today, you will need these files too.

I suggest having `dataclean_script.R` open to follow along. This script (and the tutorial) source `dataclean_helpers.R`, which we will go over in detail if we have time.

We will use `dataclean_partial_ocu.R` once during the workshop.

---

# Set Up `.Renviron`

This should allow us to all use the same code, even though we have different API tokens.

1. Go to working directory for tutorial
1. `file.edit(".Renviron")`
1. Three lines:
    1. `RCTOKEN_OCU_ORG=[your token, "Original Data"]`
    1. `RCTOKEN_OCU_CORR=[your token, "Corrected Data"]`
    1. `DOCTOKEN_OCU=[your token, "Documentation"]`
1. Restart R/RStudio in the same working directory

# Context

---

# Who I am

- Senior staff biostatistician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
- Ayumi was my first boss after graduate school 😊
- Work with the VUMC Center for Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction and Survivorship (CIBS Center), doing most statistical analysis and working with database team

---

# What is CIBS?

### icudelirium.org

- We study the sickest patients in the hospital:
    - What happens to them in the ICU?
    - What happens to them after they go home?
- Clinical trials, prospective cohort studies, retrospective EMR studies
- Most have data collected in the hospital and during long-term follow-up (several years!)
- Currently have at least six studies in data collection phase, with one just finished
- For a given study:
    - I typically communicate with 1-2 clinical project managers/coordinators in charge
    - Those PMs/coordinators communicate with other clinical data team members, either at VUMC or at other study sites

---

# Our Previous Data Cleaning Methods

- Pre-2008: 🤷🏻- data collected before I arrived, anything we found addressed in an ad hoc manner
- BRAIN-ICU (finished data collection ~2011):
    - In-hospital data: R script to find issues, but documentation was very manual process
    - Follow-up data: Google Docs; limited because we can't include PHI, got confusing
- MIND-USA (begin enrolling 2011): This process!

# Key Points for Today

(PDF Chapter 1)

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Prevention > Correction

Use REDCap's built-in features to help you *prevent* data entry mistakes!

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# This process takes a long time.

(especially at the beginning!)

# **It is worth it.**

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Clean Your Data **Early** and **Often**

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# This Is an Ongoing Process

You will need to update your R script during the study - that is OK!

# COMMUNICATION IS KEY 🔑

### Before:
Data validation tools for error prevention

.pull-right[
### After:
**Data dictionary** for working with different forms, field labels, numeric limits

**API** for exporting data automatically
